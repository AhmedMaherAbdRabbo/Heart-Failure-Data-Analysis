# Heart Failure Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a heart failure dataset using Python. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze various health metrics related to heart disease, identify patterns, and uncover insights that could contribute to early diagnosis and prevention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains various health metrics such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, old peak, ST slope, and the presence of heart disease.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
2. **Outlier Detection**: Using Z-score and IQR methods to identify and handle outliers.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the dataset to understand its characteristics.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to explore relationships between variables.
